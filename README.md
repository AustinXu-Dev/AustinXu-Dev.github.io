This project is a React-based web application for analyzing and managing car data. The application provides a dashboard to visualize car data by brands and models, a browsing section to view and favorite cars, and a highlighted section to keep track of favorite cars.

## Project Structure

- **Dashboard**: Displays various charts and statistics about cars by brand and model.
- **Browse**: Allows users to view a list of cars, filter by brand, and add cars to their favorites.
- **Highlighted**: Displays a list of favorited cars, with the ability to remove cars from favorites.

## Features

- **Persistent Highlights**: Favorite cars are stored in `localStorage` so that your selections persist even after a page reload.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and can be used on various screen sizes.
- **Pagination**: The browse section includes pagination to manage large lists of cars.
